## Video Selectoer

This project uses a Raspberry Pi 3 as a server/controller to play videos on 5 client Pi's connected via a WIFI network. This set of python scripts is running on the server. The server is hooked up to a rotary encoder and two buttons. The rotary dial allows the user to scroll through 3D models rendered on screen, a button is then used to make a selection. Once the button is pressed, a video on one of the client machines starts up. The second button shuts down all of the clients, and then the server.

There is not much special about the client Pi systems, but they need to be set up without a password so that the server can automatically connect.
